# Brain Tumor Detection using CNN

## Overview
This project aims to detect brain tumors from MRI images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The model classifies MRI scans into categories indicating the presence or absence of a tumor.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of classified MRI images of brain tumors. It includes labeled images of both normal and tumor-affected brain scans.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Image resizing and normalization
   - Data augmentation to improve generalization
2. **Model Architecture**
   - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with multiple layers
   - Activation functions like ReLU
   - Pooling layers to reduce dimensionality
   - Fully connected layers for classification
3. **Training and Evaluation**
   - Split data into training, validation, and test sets
   - Use appropriate loss function and optimizer (e.g., Adam, categorical cross-entropy)
   - Train the model and evaluate accuracy on test data

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow/Keras
- NumPy
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

Install dependencies using:
```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy opencv-python matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Usage
Run the following script to train the model:
```bash
python train.py
```
To make predictions on new MRI scans:
```bash
python predict.py --image path/to/image.jpg
```

## Results
The trained CNN model achieves high accuracy in detecting brain tumors from MRI scans. Sample visualizations and performance metrics (e.g., confusion matrix, accuracy, precision-recall) can be found in the `results` directory.

## Future Work
- Improve model accuracy with advanced architectures like ResNet or EfficientNet
- Implement Grad-CAM for interpretability
- Deploy as a web or mobile application
